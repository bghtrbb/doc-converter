This is the INSTALL file for the `doc-converter project`.  It describes
how you can install the software to a target server.

In general, See the `README` file since it contains information that
will show you how this service works and how to create a `doc-converter`
server.

Installing the software, entails installing the rpms on the client
and/or servers that you are preparing.  If you want to build the
project manually without creating rpms you should take a look at the
`README.md` file.

The `doc-converter` client software is typically done by installing
the rpm:

  $ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://doc-converter.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  $ sudo yum-config-manager --save --setopt 'doc-converter.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com.name=doc-converter' 
  $ sudo yum-config-manager --save --setopt 'doc-converter.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com.gpgcheck=0'

  $ sudo yum -y install doc-converter

Creating the `doc-converter` server is a bit more involved and is
typically done as part of a CloudFormation automated script.  It is
possible however to perform all of the steps of preparing a
`doc-converter` server by hand.


See `README.md` for all of the gory details.
